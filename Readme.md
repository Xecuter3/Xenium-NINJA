Xenium NINJA V1.0 PCB

Inspired by the original Xenium Gold design to some degree, this, although a fully functional nice chip, was my first PCB within Autodesk Eagle.

Pictured chip uses the OshPark 'After Dark' pcb.

Uses the same open source openxenium firmware. Only the four jtag pins are present to save space, use 3V3 and GND for the other two.
